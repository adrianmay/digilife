Task structure:
    Idle, life, keyboard, timer tasks
    Keyboard event can switch background task to be idle or life
    Keyboard task is a get-message loop with state-machine
    timer task has same segments as keyboard task and calls same functions
    Timer task does nothing if tank stopped
    Idle in tank for now - practice moving PC
    
Tank:
        Tank at ring 3: need ring 3 descriptor for screen, code, data. Check crashes on ring 0 segments, or int 32
	Catch tank faults and jump back in: just write PC in TSS
	Make some services available to tank through interrupts
Impressive looking Van-der-Graaff style apparatus, a big thunderstorm, wild beard and spectacles, then lurch maniacly around the house while it comes to life.
