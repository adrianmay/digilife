This depends strongly on the hardware you want to run it on. You'd have to *really* want to get it going.

This needs gcc, nasm and bochs.

Build bochs from source with --enable-cpu-level=3 and --enable-debugger. Create a hard disk image called 30M.sample using bximage (I don't want that but it complains if there's no disk.)

Make zed.img with 'make'.

Type 'make run' to run bochs with zed as the OS. Enter c when it stops in the debugger.
