Have bootloader figure out kernel size automatically: makeboot can write it in image around byte 508ish
Random number supply
Tank:
    Make two TSSs, one for current boot process, the other for life. 
    Load Task register with boot process
    Enter boot TSS in IDT for timer.
    End of boot process changes to: jump other task, label {print tock, iret, jmp label} or something like that
    Other task prints dots
    Then:
        Tank at ring 3: need ring 3 descriptor for screen, code, data. Check crashes on ring 0 segments, or int 32
	Catch tank faults and jump back in: just write PC in TSS
	Make some services available to tank through interrupts
Impressive looking Van-der-Graaff style apparatus, a big thunderstorm, wild beard and spectacles, then lurch maniacly around the house while it comes to life.
