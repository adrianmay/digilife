This depends strongly on the hardware you want to run it on. You'd have to *really* want to get it going.

This needs gcc, nasm and VirtualBox.
Make with 'make'.
Create a VirtualBox VM called 'Zed' with zed.img as a floppy disk. The VM should have VT-x/AMD-V checked (if your hardware is new enough) otherwise VirtualBox might not check segment limits. 
Type 'make run' to run the VM.
